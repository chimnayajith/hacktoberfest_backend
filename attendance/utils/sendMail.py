        <p><strong>Event:</strong> amFOSS Hacktoberfest</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22nd October 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM</p>

            To maximize the event's benefits, we urge you to bring your laptop along with your charger. Without it, 
            you will be unable to work together and send PRs. Although you can attend the talks and share laptops, 
            you will need to send PRs individually to compete in games and make contributions to win GitHub swag 
            and other prizes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, make sure you install 
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git Bash</a> and create a 
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account as you will need them to use the terminal commands 
            and contribute. You don't have to install Git Bash if you are using Linux or macOS.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Important</strong>: Please ensure that you have the <strong>QR code</strong> attached to this email ready at the entrance for check-in. Without it, you wonâ€™t be able to enter the venue.
